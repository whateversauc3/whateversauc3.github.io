Dave Collins is a husband, a dad, and a hacker. In his free time he enjoys spending time with his family and playing pen and paper role playing games like D&D and Shadowrun. He also enjoys writing code and his current favorite language is Python. This site was built so he could learn about static HTML sites, Jekyll (and then by extension markdown) as well as using git. If you want to reach out, he's on Twitter @whatever\_sauce

All the material here is for educational purposes and no, I won't hack your girlfriends Facebook page, I'll probably just mock you instead.



Have a great day and HACK THE PLANET!
